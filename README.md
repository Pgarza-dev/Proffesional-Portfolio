# Proffesional-Portfolio

This is a Portfolio I built to showcase my work during my first year at Noroff.

Upon entering the Portfolio site you will see an photo of myself along with a
short background discription text about myself followd by two clickable GitHub and a Linked-In
icons to allow for quick and easy access to more information about my work and experience.
My Tech Stack is displayed with icons to signify what I have worked with for these projects.
